                When considering what and where to study, Genisis higher Education
                counsellor will match your academic interests and your career
                goals with course information from universities and institutions
                across the world. It is very important that you think about the
                convenience of the study location for you, the institutionâ€™s
                ranking, the amount of time you would like to spend away from
                home and the total cost of studying and living overseas. Your
                counsellor will be able to guide you on the courses,
                institutions and locations that best meet your preferences.

                There are a limited number of scholarships and bursaries
                available for international students. The amount varies by level
                of study and by institution. Scholarships are competitive and
                you need to demonstrate exceptional academic achievements.
                Governments and other organisations also provide a number of
                scholarships and awards to help international students study
                overseas.

                The opportunity for students to work part-time during their
                studies varies from country to country. Many universities have a
                dedicated job centre on-campus for students that advertise job
                opportunities to help students develop skills. The university
                careers service is also a useful source of information. If you
                pursue a course at degree level or above you may be permitted to
                work while on an international student visa.

                The average time taken is anywhere between 8 to 12 weeks
                depending on the individual case, so the students need to apply
                for their application at least 3 months prior to their course
                commencement. The process can be quicker for certain countries.
